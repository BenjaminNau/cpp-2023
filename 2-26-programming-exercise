/*
Instructions
A room has one door, two windows, and a built-in bookshelf and it needs to be painted. Suppose that one gallon of paint can paint 120 square feet.

Write a program that prompts the user to input the length and width (in feet) of:

The door
Each window
The bookshelf
And the length, width, and height of the room.
The program outputs:

The amount of paint needed to paint the walls of the room.
