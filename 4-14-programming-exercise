/*
The short-term, 0-24 hours, parking fee, F, at an international airport is given by the following formula:

     5,               if 0 <= h <= 3
F =  6 * int(h + 1),  if 3 < h <= 9
     60,              if 9 < h <= 24

where int(h + 1) is the integer value of h + 1. For example, int(3.2) = 3, int(4.8) = 4.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of hours a car is parked at the airport and outputs the parking fee.
