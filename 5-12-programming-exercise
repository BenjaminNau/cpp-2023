/*
The population of town A is less than the population of town B. However, the population of town A is growing faster than the population of town B.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

The population of town A
The population of town B
The growth rate of town A
The growth rate of town B
The program outputs:

After how many years the population of town A will be greater than or equal to the population of town B
The populations of both the towns at that time.
(A sample input is: Population of town A = 5,000, growth rate of town A = 4%, population of town B = 8,000, and growth rate of town B = 2%.)
