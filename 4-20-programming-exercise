/*
The cost of renting a room at a hotel is, say $100.00 per night. For special occasions, such as a wedding or conference, the hotel offers a special discount as follows.

If the number of rooms booked is:

at least 10, the discount is 10%
at least 20, the discount is 20%
at least 30, the discount is 30%
Also if rooms are booked for at least three days, then there is an additional 5% discount.

Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

The cost of renting one room
The number of rooms booked
The number of days the rooms are booked
The sales tax (as a percent).
The program outputs:

The cost of renting one room
The discount on each room as a percent
The number of rooms booked
The number of days the rooms are booked
The total cost of the rooms
The sales tax
The total billing amount.
Your program must use appropriate named constants to store special values such as various discounts.

Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals with a precision to 2 decimals.
