The value of π can be approximated by using the following series : (Leibniz formula for pi)

Series to approximate pi
The program in main.cpp uses this series to find the approximate value of π. However, the statements are in the incorrect order, and there is also a bug in this program.

Rearrange the statements and remove the bug so that this program can be used to approximate π.
