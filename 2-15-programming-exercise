/*
Write a program to implement and test the algorithm that you designed for Exercise 15 of Chapter 1. The instructions to Exercise 15 have been posted below for your convenience:

Exercise 15
Given the radius, in inches, and price of a pizza, design an algorithm to find the price of the pizza per square inch.

You may assume that the value of Ï€ = 3.141593.

In your program, declare a named constant PI to store this value.

Below is an example of how the completed program should work:

Enter the radius of the pizza: 20

Enter the price of the pizza: 22

The price per square inch is: 0.017507
Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals.
*/

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // needed for pow()
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    float radius, priceOfPizza, pricePerSquareInch;
    const float PI = 3.141593;

    cout << "What is the radius, in inches, and the price of the pizza: " << endl;
    cin >> radius >> priceOfPizza;


    pricePerSquareInch = priceOfPizza / (PI * (pow(radius, 2))); // price / area, area = pi*r^2

    cout << "The price per square inch is $" << fixed << setprecision(3)
    << pricePerSquareInch  << endl; // 3 decimal places to get the desired output

    return 0;
}
