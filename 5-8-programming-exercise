/*
Write a program that uses while loops to perform the following steps:

Prompt the user to input two integers: firstNum and secondNum
(firstNum must be less than secondNum).
Output all odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum.
Separate each number with a space
Output the sum of all even numbers between firstNum and secondNum.
Output the numbers and their squares between 1 and 10.
Output the sum of the square of the odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum.
Output all uppercase letters.
Separate each letter with a space
