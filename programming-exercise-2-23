/*
Cindy uses the services of a brokerage firm to buy and sell stocks. The firm charges 1.5% service charges on the total amount for each transaction, buy or sell. When Cindy sells stocks, she would like to know if she gained or lost on a particular investment.

Instructions
Write a program that allows Cindy to input:

The purchase price of each share
The selling price of each share
The number of shares sold
The program outputs:

The total amount invested
The total amount received from selling
The total service charges
Amount gained or lost
An example program is shown below:

Enter the buying price of each share: 13.23

Enter the selling price of each share: 14.00

Enter the number of shares sold: 43

Total amount invested: $ 577.423
Total amount received: $ 592.97
Total service charges: $ 17.5633
Amount gained or lost: $15.5466
Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals.
