/*
Two cars A and B leave an intersection at the same time. Car A travels west at an average speed of x miles per hour and car B travels south at an average speed of y miles per hour.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

The average speed of both the cars
The elapsed time (in hours and minutes, separated by a space)
Ex: For two hours and 30 minutes, 2 30 would be entered
The program then outputs:

The (shortest) distance between the cars.
Because your answer should be in decimal format with a precision to at least 2 decimal places, be careful when performing mathematical operations on different data types, it might give you unexpected results.
