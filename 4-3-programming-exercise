/*
Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer between 0 and 35. The prompt should say Enter an integer between 0 and 35:.

If the number is less than or equal to 9, the program should output the number; otherwise, it should output:

A for 10
B for 11
C for 12
. . .
and Z for 35.
(Hint: For numbers >= 10, calculate the ACSII value for the corresponding letter and convert it to a char using the cast operator, static_cast<char>().)

/*
"number - 10" subtracts 10 from the number i.e., when
number = 10, it becomes 0. 

'A' + 1 in the context of char, equals B, and so on
