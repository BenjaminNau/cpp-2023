/*
Paula and Danny want to plant evergreen trees along the back side of their yard. They do not want to have an excessive number of trees.

Write a program that prompts the user to input the following:

The length of the yard.
The radius of a fully grown tree. (Use 3.14159 as the constant value for any calculations that may need Ï€).
The required space between fully grown trees.
The program outputs:

The number of trees that can be planted in the yard
The total space that will be occupied by the fully grown trees.
Format your output with setprecision(2) to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
*/

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    const double PI = 3.14159;
    double yardLength,treeRadius,spaceBetweenTrees,spaceForSingleTree;
    int numberOfTrees;
    double totalAreaofAllTrees;
    

    cout << "Enter the length of the yard: ";

    cout << "Enter the radius of a fully grown tree: ";
    cin >> treeRadius;

    cout << "Enter the required space between the grown trees";
    cin >> spaceBetweenTrees;

    spaceForSingleTree = 2 * treeRadius + spaceBetweenTrees;

    numberOfTrees = (yardLength / spaceForSingleTree);

    totalAreaofAllTrees = (PI * pow(treeRadius, 2)) * numberOfTrees;

    cout << endl << "number of trees that can be planted are: " << numberOfTrees << endl;
    cout << "space occupied by trees are: " << fixed << showpoint << setprecision(2) << totalAreaofAllTrees << endl;
