/*
A room has one door, two windows, and a built-in bookshelf and it needs to be painted. Suppose that one gallon of paint can paint 120 square feet.

Write a program that prompts the user to input (in feet):

The length and width of the door
The length and width of each window
The length and width of the bookshelf
The length, width, and height of the room
The area that can be painted with one gallon of paint
The program outputs:

The amount of paint needed to paint the walls of the room.
