/*
Summary
Newton’s law states that the force, F, between two bodies of masses M1 and M2 is given by:

Newton's Law
in which k is the gravitational constant and d is the distance between the bodies. The value of k is approximately 6.67 X 10-8 dyn. cm²/g² .

Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to input:

The masses of the bodies
The distance between the bodies.
The program then outputs:

The force between the bodies.
Your program should be able to work with decimals.
