/*
Dairy Farm decided to ship milk in containers in the form of cubes rather than cylinders.

Write a program that prompts the user to input:

The radius of the base of a cylindrical container
The height of the cylindrical container
The program then outputs:

The side of the cube with the same volume as the cylindrical container with a precision of 2 decimal places.
You may assume that the value of Ï€ = 3.141593.

Format your output with setprecision(2) to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!

/*
volume of cylinder = pi * (r * r) * h , the cube root of cylinder volume would equal the side of the cube
