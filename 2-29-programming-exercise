/*
A contractor orders, say, 30 cubic yards of premixed concrete to construct a patio that is to be, say, four inches thick. The length of the patio is to be, say, twice the width.

Write a program that prompts the user to specify:

The amount of premixed concrete (in cubic yards) ordered
The thickness of the patio (in inches)
The ratio of length and width
Ex. If the ratio is 3 to 2, have the program accept a 3 then a 2. Then compute the ratio using these numbers
The program then outputs:

The length and width of the patio (in feet). (1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet.)
To calculate the width, you will need to:

Find the total cubic feet of the concrete
Divide the total cubic feet of concrete by the result of the length to width ratio multiplied by the thickness of the patio, over 12 (inches in a foot)
Square root the answer
To find the square root of a decimal number, include the header file cmath using the statement #include <cmath>, in your program.

The function sqrt, included in this header file, determines the square root of a decimal number. For example, sqrt(16.0) = 4.0.

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double concreteOrdered, patioThickness, lengthRatio, widthRatio;

    cout << "enter the amount of premixed concrete ordered ";
    cin >> concreteOrdered;

    cout << "enter the thickness of the patio ";
    cin >> patioThickness;

    cout << "enter the ratio of the length to width ";
    cin >> lengthRatio >> widthRatio;

    // 1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet, display this here
    double totalCubicFeet = concreteOrdered * 27;

    double width = sqrt(totalCubicFeet / ((lengthRatio / widthRatio) * (patioThickness / 12)));
    
    // use length and width ratio
    double length = (lengthRatio / widthRatio) * width;

    cout << "the length of the patio is " << length << " feet " << "and the width of the patio is " << width << " feet" << endl;

    return 0;
}
