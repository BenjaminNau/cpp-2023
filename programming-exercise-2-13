/*
To make a profit, a local store marks up the prices of its items by a certain percentage.

Write a C++ program that reads:

The original price of the item sold
The percentage of the marked-up price
The sales tax rate.
The program then outputs:

The original price of the item
The percentage of the mark-up
The storeâ€™s selling price of the item
The sales tax rate
The sales tax
The final price of the item.
(The final price of the item is the selling price plus the sales tax.)
Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals.
