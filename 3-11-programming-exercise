/*
A size of a jumbo candy bar with rectangular shape is l x w x h. Due to rising costs of cocoa, the volume of the candy bar is to be reduced by p%.

To accomplish this, the management decided to keep the height of the candy bar the same, and reduce the length and width by the same amount.

For example, if l = 12, w = 7, h = 3, and p = 10, then the new dimension of the candy bar is 11.39 x 6.64 x 3.

Below is an example of how the completed program should work:

Enter the length, width, and height of the candy bar separated by space(s): 12 7 3

Enter the amount of the reduced volume as a percentage: 10

The new dimensions of the candy bar is: 11.38 x 6.64 x 3.00
Format your output with setprecision(2) to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath> // for the sqrt function

using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    double length, width, height, reducedVolumePercent;

    cout << "Enter the length, width, and height of the candy bar separated by space(s): ";
    cin >> length >> width >> height;

    cout << "Enter the amount of the reduced volume as a percentage: ";
    cin >> reducedVolumePercent;

    double reducedHorizontalDimensionPercent = 100 * (1 - sqrt(1 - reducedVolumePercent / 100));

    length = length - (length * reducedHorizontalDimensionPercent / 100);
    width = width - (width * reducedHorizontalDimensionPercent / 100);

    cout << "The new dimensions of the candy bar is: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << length << " x " << width << " x " << height << endl;    
    return 0;
}

IF YOU ARE CONFUSED ON THE reducedHorizontalDimensionPercent, vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

    Volume = l * w * h

height remains constant, and the volume is reduced by p%, the product of the 
length and the width is also reduced by p%. find new length and width, l' and w':

    l' * w' = l * w * (1 - p/100)

reduce both the length and the width by the same percentage:

    l' = l * (1 - q/100)
    w' = w * (1 - q/100)

plugging into the modified volume equation, we have:

    l * (1 - q/100) * w * (1 - q/100) = l * w * (1 - p/100)

solving for q:

    q = 100 * (1 - sqrt(1 - p/100))

So, you would decrease both the length and the width by this calculated q% to get the new dimensions of the candy bar.
