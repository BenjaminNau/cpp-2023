A piece of wire is to be bent in the form of a circle to put around a picture frame.

Write a program that prompts the user to input:

The length of the wire
The program then outputs:

the radius and area of the circle.
You may assume that Ï€ = 3.1416. Declare PI as a named constant with this value.
