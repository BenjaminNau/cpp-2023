Summary
You found an exciting summer job for five weeks. It pays, say, $15.50 per hour. Suppose that the total tax you pay on your summer job income is 14%.

After paying the taxes, you spend 10% of your net income to buy new clothes and other accessories for the next school year and 1% to buy school supplies.

After buying clothes and school supplies, you use 25% of the remaining money to buy savings bonds. For each dollar you spend to buy savings bonds, your parents spend $0.50 to buy additional savings bonds for you.

Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

The pay rate for an hour and the number of hours you worked each week for 5 weeks.
The program then outputs the following:

Your income before and after taxes from your summer job.

The money you spend on clothes and other accessories.

The money you spend on school supplies.

The money you spend to buy savings bonds.

The money your parents spend to buy additional savings bonds for you.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter the per hour pay rate: 15.50

Enter the number of hours worked for week 1: 21

Enter the number of hours worked for week 2: 23

Enter the number of hours worked for week 3: 21

Enter the number of hours worked for week 4: 30

Enter the number of hours worked for week 5: 21

Total Income before tax: $ 1798
Net Income: $ 1546.28
Money spent on clothes and other accessories: $ 154.628
Money spent on school supplies: $ 15.4628
Money spent to buy savings bonds: $ 344.047
Money spent by parents to buy additional savings bonds: $ 172.024
