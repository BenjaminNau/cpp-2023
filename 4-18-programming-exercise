/*
One way to determine how healthy a person is, is by measuring the body fat of the person. The formulas to determine the body fat for female and male are as follows:

Body fat formula for women:

A1 = (body weight X 0.732) + 8.987
A2 = wrist measurement (at fullest point) / 3.140
A3 = waist measurement (at navel) X 0.157
A4 = hip measurement (at fullest point) X 0.249
A5 = forearm measurement (at fullest point) X 0.434
B = A1 + A2 - A3 - A4 + A5
Body fat = body weight - B
Body fat percentage = body fat X 100 / body weight
Body fat formula for men:

A1 = (body weight X 1.082) + 94.42
A2 = waist measurement X 4.15
B = A1 - A2
Body fat = body weight - B
Body fat percentage = body fat X 100 / body weight
Instructions
Write a program to calculate the body fat of a person. Prompt the user to input:

Their gender ('m' or 'M' for male, 'f' or 'F' for female)
If male was entered, additionally prompt the user to input:

Their body weight (in pounds)
Their waist measurement at fullest point (in inches)
If female was entered, additionally prompt the user to input:

Their body weight (in pounds)
Their wrist measurement at fullest point (in inches)
Their waist measurement at navel (in inches)
Their hip measurement at fullest point (in inches)
Their forearm measurement at fullest point (in inches)
The program then outputs:

Body fat
Body fat percentage
