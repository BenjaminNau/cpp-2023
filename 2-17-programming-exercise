/*
A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy farm ships cartons of milk to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one liter of milk and the profit of each carton of milk vary from farm to farm.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

The total amount of milk produced in the morning.

The cost of producing one liter of milk.

The profit on each carton of milk.

The program then outputs:

The number of milk cartons needed to hold milk.

Round your answer to the nearest integer.
The cost of producing milk.

The profit for producing milk.
