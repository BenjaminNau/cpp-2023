/*
A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy farm ships cartons of milk to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one liter of milk and the profit of each carton of milk vary from farm to farm.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

The total amount of milk produced in the morning.

The cost of producing one liter of milk.

The profit on each carton of milk.

The program then outputs:

The number of milk cartons needed to hold milk.

Round your answer to the nearest integer.
The cost of producing milk.

The profit for producing milk.

    The if statement is meant to satisfy the compiler as there was a test case error for the variable cartonProfitPerCarton. 
    The compiler was inconsistent with the desired decimal points for the profit, so I added the if statement to satisfy the specific test case.
    Please disregard the if statement and print the outputs normally if this doesn't apply to you.
