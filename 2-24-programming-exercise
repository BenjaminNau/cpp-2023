/*
A piece of wire is to be bent in the form of a rectangle to put around a picture frame. The length of the picture frame is 1.5 times the width.

Write a program that prompts the user to input:

The length of the wire
The program then outputs:

The length and width of the picture frame.
*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double lengthOfWire;

    cout << "what is the length of the wire? ";
    cin >> lengthOfWire;

    double width = lengthOfWire / 5;
    double length = 1.5 * width;

    cout << "the length and the width of the wire picture frame is " << length << ", " << width;
    return 0;
}

/*
To understand this problem further, use the perimeter equation.

The equation for finding perimeter(lengthOfWire) is as follows:
P = 2L + 2W

We know:
L = 1.5W

Substitute:

P = 2(1.5W) + 2W

We have P in respect to W, so we can solve for W, solving, we get P = P/5
