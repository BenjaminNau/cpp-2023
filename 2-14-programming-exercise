/*
If you buy a 40 GB hard drive, then chances are that the actual storage on the hard drive is not 40 GB. This is due to the fact that, typically, a manufacturer uses 1,000 bytes as the value of 1K bytes, 1,000 K bytes as the value of 1 MB, 1,000 MB as the value of 1 GB. Therefore, a 40 GB hard drive contains 40,000,000,000 bytes.

However, in computer memory, as given in Table 1-1 (Chapter 1), 1 KB is equal to 1,024 bytes, and so on. So the actual storage on a 40 GB hard drive is approximately 37.25 GB. (You might like to read the fine print next time you buy a hard drive.)

Instructions
Write a program that:

Prompts the user to enter the size of the hard drive specified by the manufacturer, on the hard drive box.
Outputs the actual storage capacity of the hard drive.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  double size = 0;

  cout << "Enter the size of the hard drive specified by the manufacturer, in gigabytes: ";
  cin >> size;

  double bytesofGigabyte = (size * 1024 * 1024 * 1024);
  double physicalStorageBytes = (size * 1000 * 1000 * 1000);
  double discrepancyInBytes= (bytesofGigabyte - physicalStorageBytes);
  double discrepancyInGigabytes = (discrepancyInBytes / (1024 * 1024 * 1024));
  double actualSize = size - discrepancyInGigabytes;

  cout<< "The actual storage capacity of the hard drive is "<< actualSize << " gigabytes" << endl;
}
